# Leaply UI Sandbox - International Education Platform

This repository is a live, interactive prototype for validating the design and user experience of the Leaply platform. It contains a collection of static HTML, CSS, and JS files that bring our design concepts to life, allowing for hands-on testing and better decision-making.

**Note:** This is a design sandbox, not a functional application. All data is for demonstration purposes only, and there is no backend functionality.
